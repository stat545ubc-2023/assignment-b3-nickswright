# Shiny App

This shiny app allows users to examine the mass distribution of the Palmer penguins dataset. It shows a histogram of penguins' body mass and a table with the entire dataset.
For the purposes of this assignment I selected these 3 features to improve the app's utility:
  1. An interactive table in which the user can select the number of entries, search for entries, and order the data
  2. A button allowing users to download a .csv file of the table
  3. A plot of penguin mass in which users can select the range of data displayed and the color fill
