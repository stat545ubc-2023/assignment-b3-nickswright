# Shiny App

### Primary Functionality
This shiny app allows users to examine the mass distribution of the Palmer penguins dataset. It contains two main features:
  1. A histogram that allows the user to explore the mass distribution of the entire Palmer penguin population
  2. A table that allows the user to examine, in detail, other characteristics of the Palmer penguins including species, island, sex, year, and 3 other morphological characteristics.

### Assignment B-3
[Shiny App B3 Link](https://nicholaswright.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-nickswright/)
For Assignment B-3 I selected these 3 features:
  1. An interactive table in which the user can select the number of entries, search for entries, and order the data
  2. A button allowing users to download a .csv file of the table
  3. A plot of penguin mass in which users can select the range of data displayed and the color fill

### Assignment B-4
For assignment B-4 I added these 3 features to further improve the app's utility
  1. The shinytheme spacelab to give the app a cleaner, more visually appealing background
  2. An image of the three penguin species to improve the aesthetic of the app and provide some context for the relative sizes of the 3 species in question
  3. Two separate tabs for the plot and table using tabsetPanel to make the app less visually cluttered
